# bambiui accessibility acceptance

## Automated evidence

- Unit tests check inheritance, migration, generated contrast, derived roles and finite color-audit pairs. The default light/dark palettes pass 127 modeled pairs per theme at 4.5:1 normal-text and 3:1 non-text thresholds; manual overrides and imports can fail and are reported.
- `node scripts/studio-smoke.mjs --screenshots` runs against the static export after `npm run build`, using Chromium/CDP and a disposable browser profile. Captures are written to `.next/color-review/`; screenshot capture alone is not visual acceptance.
- Route checks directly open all 16 URLs: `/`, `/develop`, and both `/<id>` and `/develop/<id>` for `button`, `input`, `card`, `badge`, `switch`, `checkbox`, and `text`. They check real navigation links with `aria-current="page"`, headings, inspector scope/visibility, header Design/Develop selection, the absence of breadcrumbs and browser Back/Forward.
- Persistent-layout checks compare DOM identity and retain the same button count and input value across theme changes and client navigation. One theme pane contains all seven mounted, expanded specimens, alongside the Colors and Text foundation areas; switching Light/Dark changes tokens rather than creating independent demo state.
- Canvas smoke checks target a transformed, non-scrollable desktop camera: viewport width/height without native scrollbars, route-selection camera animation (instant with reduced motion), Fit, Reset zoom, zoom in/out, unbounded empty-background pointer dragging, wheel panning, Shift+wheel horizontal panning, Ctrl/⌘+wheel pointer-anchored zoom, focused-canvas arrow panning and interactive specimen controls. On desktop, Ctrl/⌘+wheel **over the canvas** is intentionally consumed for canvas zoom, so that gesture does not zoom the browser there. Elsewhere, browser zoom remains available. This is limited keyboard coverage, not a complete keyboard accessibility audit. Canvas scaling is not browser zoom.
- Develop checks cover separation from the hidden canvas/inspector, copying React usage to the browser clipboard and selected-theme token references. Color checks retain both-theme preset application, override/geometry preservation, invalid input rejection, contrast warnings, CSS/JSON export, JSON import and reload persistence. Foundation checks cover the live color-scale swatch and typography Text sample, exported CSS and reload persistence; color edits remain theme-specific while typography and geometry edits synchronize across themes. Old v3 JSON files without the optional foundation fields still import.
- At a 375px emulated viewport, checks exercise all seven component navigation targets in Design and Develop, page-width and header-control overflow, inspector/preview focus links, header theme selection and selected accessible names. Mobile emulation additionally checks document scrolling, touch-action and that canvas touchmove is not canceled. These checks do not prove native mobile pinch-to-zoom or a real touch-scrolling session. CDP accessibility-tree assertions are not a screen-reader session; viewport emulation is not browser-native zoom.

Previous validation (2026-09-25): production build, lint, 95 unit tests and transformed-camera smoke with screenshots passed before the Text and foundation additions. Manual gates below remain outstanding; automated success does not close them.

## Manual acceptance still required

Record browser/OS, assistive technology, scenario, result and issues before closing this gate.

### VoiceOver with Safari and Chrome

- [ ] Navigate landmarks and headings. Skip-to-workspace reaches main; the hidden workspace panel and the inspector in Develop are absent from reading order. There is only one theme pane, not an inactive second preview.
- [ ] Component and Design/Develop navigation announce links and the current page, not tabs. Tab reaches each link and Enter navigates. Verify all seven component targets, direct opening, Back/Forward, focus placement and route-change announcements.
- [ ] Light and Dark theme controls announce their selected state in Design and Develop and identify the inspector's editing target in Design; switching retains the same interactive demo state across themes and routes.
- [ ] Explore all seven expanded specimens and the Colors and Text foundation areas. Canvas help, zoom output, Fit and Reset zoom are understandable; focused-canvas arrow panning and zoom controls provide alternatives to pointer dragging. Interactive specimen controls do not initiate panning; check text selection separately in real browsers.
- [ ] Develop usage, prop references, token tables and local scroll regions are readable and keyboard reachable; Copy React code announces success or failure without moving focus unexpectedly.
- [ ] Input labels, helper text, required state and errors are announced. Read-only controls stay focusable; disabled controls cannot activate.
- [ ] Switch/Checkbox names and checked/mixed states are announced; decorative icons do not duplicate names.
- [ ] Busy buttons remain focusable and cannot activate. Verify against a consuming example with an actual action handler; the studio's loading specimen has none.
- [ ] Contrast warnings and import/copy feedback announce meaningful changes without excessive interruption.
- [ ] Export dialog announces title and description, contains focus, closes on Escape and restores focus to its trigger.

### Native zoom and layout

- [ ] Use actual browser 200% zoom (not canvas zoom). All controls remain reachable and readable without obscured keyboard focus. On desktop, verify browser zoom still works via browser controls, keyboard shortcuts and Ctrl/⌘+wheel outside the canvas; Ctrl/⌘+wheel on the canvas intentionally zooms the canvas instead.
- [ ] Check the full-bleed Design canvas in both Light and Dark at desktop and mobile viewport widths, including the floating zoom controls, and check Develop. There is no desktop/mobile preview toggle. Local code/table scrolling is expected; page-wide horizontal scrolling is not.
- [ ] Check mobile Safari/Chrome at 375px and increased system text size, including native document touch scrolling and pinch-to-zoom (neither should be intercepted by the canvas), all seven component navigation links in both views, Edit tokens / Back to preview focus navigation in Design, the inspector, expanded Color builder and export dialog.

### Color and interaction review

- [ ] Verify focus visibility in Safari/Chrome on non-default backgrounds and near container edges.
- [ ] Test forced-colors/high-contrast settings; state is not conveyed by color alone.
- [ ] In the Color scales editor, use only the keyboard to reach each role and stop (50–1000), edit and reset overrides, and verify the role, stop, current value and invalid input feedback are announced. Check the live swatch and Develop ramp table in both themes; swatch color alone must not convey the value or selection. Review contrast of text on custom swatches, including invalid or low-contrast overrides.
- [ ] In the Typography editor, reach heading, paragraph, label and caption fields by keyboard; verify variant, property, unit, bounds and validation feedback are announced. Edit heading font size and check Text preview, exported CSS and Develop reference at normal and 200% browser zoom, with long text, increased system text size and reflow. Text visual variant must not imply heading semantics: check the actual heading level and reading order; a visual label must not replace an associated form label.
- [ ] Review imported/custom values separately; old v3 saves without foundation fields still import, migration preserves legacy colors, and applying generated colors preserves component overrides. Check light/dark independence after edits and reload.

Manual VoiceOver sessions, real 200% browser zoom, desktop modified-wheel behavior in real browsers, and mobile native scroll/pinch-to-zoom have not been completed. No WCAG conformance claim is made.
